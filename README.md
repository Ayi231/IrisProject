# IrisProject
Analyzing the iris dataset to explore relationships between features and species. Visualizations helped in understanding these differences.
First, I looked into the pandas and seaborn modules to understand how to use them. I used the seaborn module to import the iris dataset and tried to understand the data by printing using the .head(), .info(), and .describe() methods, which I later commented out. 
I used a pairplot to help visualize the data, but then realized I needed to import matplotlib.pyplot to display the data in a relevant format.
